# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY, 
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL, 
track_id varchar NOT NULL, 
popularity integer NOT NULL, 
danceability decimal(4, 3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4, 3) NOT NULL, 
song_key integer NOT NULL, 
loudness decimal(5, 3) NOT NULL, 
song_mode integer NOT NULL, 
speechiness decimal(5, 4) NOT NULL, 
acousticness decimal(6, 5) NOT NULL, 
instrumentalness decimal(8, 7) NOT NULL, 
liveness decimal(5, 4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4, 3) NOT NULL, 
tempo decimal(6, 3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL, 
time_signature integer NOT NULL);

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#After inserting the Spotify Data, I noticed that not all of the data had transferred over; 2 rows of data were missing. Based on the errors; I was able to determine it was line 42 and 43. I inserted those two rows with the following SQL:

INSERT INTO Spotifydata
VALUES 
(42,"Internet Money","Lemonade (feat. Gunna, Don Toliver & NAV)","7hxHWCCAIIxFLCzvDgnQHX",81,0.8,0.658,1,-6.142,0,0.079,0.25,0.0,0.111,0.462,140.042,195429,4)
(43,"Doja Cat","Woman","6Uj1ctrBOjOas8xZXGqKk4",95,0.824,0.764,5,-4.175,0,0.0854,0.0888,0.00294,0.117,0.881,107.998,172627,4);

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT SUM(popularity) AS popularity,
    artist_name    
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;


#2. What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, 
    MAX(duration_ms) AS song_length
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#3. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT track_name,
    popularity,
    AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#4. What artist has the highest energy and what is their top song based on energy?

SELECT artist_name,
    track_name,
    MAX(energy) AS high_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#5. What artist(s) has the most songs in the top 50?

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name,
    COUNT(track_name) AS num_of_tracks
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY num_of_tracks DESC
LIMIT 2;
